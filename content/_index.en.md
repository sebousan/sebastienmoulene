    I'm Sébastien Moulène, a senior front-end developer living in Bordeaux, France.
    

    I have been in this business for more than 20 years and I specialize in the design of high-performance, accessible to all and low-carbon websites.
    
    
    I recently created [Un Cinq](https://uncinq.dev/) to highlight this know-how.
